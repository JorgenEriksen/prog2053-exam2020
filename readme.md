First task with DOM is in oppgave1.html, and secound task is in oppgave3.html / edit-user.js.

I didn't understand how it was suppose for us to run this program, so what I did was to edit the index.php to make it work, so to make it run oppgave3.html I wrote 'readfile("oppgave3.html");' and to run 'readfile("oppgave1.html")'. See my index.php to see what I mean. I have run the program on localhost with docker.


I did get everything to work, exept to update the database both on the first and the second task, I didn't have any information about how to do it, but you can see how I tried in the code by doing the fetch function to 'api/updateUser.php' with method PUT, and with the userinformation in the body.
